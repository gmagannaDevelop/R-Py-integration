# R-Py-integration

What has worked for me combining these two beautiful languages. What I hope will turn into a useful set of tools and a standard workflow.

## Motivation

I keep feeling that I have to do too much manual configuration for these two to naturally work. **What if just want to concentrate on my actual work?** Developping this repo might be time-consuming but I'm betting that it'll save me some time and most of all, spare me of future headaches. 

## Foundations

These are the software packages that will help me build this repo.

* For Python, [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Because I've had dantesque nightmares trying to reproduce conda environments. Conda might be beginner and non-technical people friendly, but in the long run **it's not worth it**. Trust me, reproducibility means peace of mind, which I find to be priceless.

* For R, [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/). It's the most sane thing I've seen around. I've found it has some drawbacks when changing R versions. I think this should be a feature, but I am not experienced enough writing R code to open a pull request. Maybe in the future, sorry.
